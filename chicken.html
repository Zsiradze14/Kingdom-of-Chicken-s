    <p>The <b> chicken </b> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl, is a type of domesticated
        fowl, originally
        from Southeastern Asia. <b>Rooster</b> <br> or cock is a term for
        an adult male bird. A younger male may be called a cockerel; a male that has been castrated is a capon. The
        adult female bird is <br> ca
        lled a hen. "Chicken" was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird, but thanks to its
        usage on restauran
        t menus has now become the most
    </p>

    <h2> Terminology </h2>
    <p> An adult male is a called a cock or rooster (in the United States) and an adult female is called a hen.[10][11]

        Other terms are:

        biddy: newly hatched chicken <sup> <a href="sorce.com">[12][13]</a></sup> <br>
        capon: castrated or neutered male chicken[a]
        chick: young chicken[14]
        chook /tʃʊk/: chicken (Australia, informal)[15]
        cockerel: young male chicken less than a year old[16] <br>
        pullet: young female chicken less than a year old.[17] In the poultry industry, a pullet is a sexually immature
        chicken less than 22 weeks of age.[18]
        yardbird: chicken <br> (southern United States, dialectal)[19]
        Historically, a chicken was any young domesticated bird, and the species was called domestic fowl or fowl.[20]

        Chicken may also mean a chick <br>(see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[21]</p>
    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>According to Merriam-Webster, the term "rooster" (i.e. a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late 18th
        century as a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original English "cock",<br>[22][23][24] and is
        widely
        used throughout North America.
        "Roosting" is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night, which is done by both sexes.
